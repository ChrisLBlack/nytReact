# nytReact

This is a full-stack application built on the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, and Node).  It essentially scrapes data from the NY Times website and saves it to a database.  The user can then load the page with the data-base data with current stories, pictures, etc.  They can also search for stories, comment on them, or delete them from the front-end.
